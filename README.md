Hello,

I am Arjeus Guevarra. I am a graduate of BS Electronics Engineering and has worked in the industry for 9 years specializing on Microelectronics. I went into the field of data science thereafter and then aimed to become an AI researcher by studying MS Computer Science in University of the Philippines Diliman. My interests and research are about robotics, computer vision,SLAM and machine learning based on Boolean Logic, which you can see through this [Iink](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338533527_Machine_learning_and_reasoning_through_Boolean_logic)
